title: The Biggest Challenge I've Faced as I Learn to Be a Developer
---

This is an interesting topic for me to write about, as the challenges have been multiple.

**Challenges**
1) Currently working 2 jobs and doing Bloc coursework
2) Day job increased hours from 30 to 40 per week
3) Decreased second job from 25 hours a week to 8 hours
4) Husband was diagnosed with cancer, and now had to fit in his hospital, doctor, chemo, and radiation visits while still giving time to day jobs
5) Overcoming my own frustrations about not immediately understanding what I'm learning

I was always a good student, and learning came easy to me. This is NOT the case with what I'm learning from Bloc. The speed with which we are learning is also challenging. I am in awe of anyone who is able to put in 40 hours a week on this, because I think my brain would explode.

So my biggest challenge, I would have to say is time management. Second would be just comprehending and learning the languages and techniques being presented. Something as simple as remembering how to start and stop Jekyll, or start atom from within terminal, or how to use markdown language. I google search constantly to try to keep moving forward.
