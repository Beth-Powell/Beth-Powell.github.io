title: My Experience With Bloc
---

Bloc has been a real experience so far for me. I was very apprehensive at first both because of the overall cost of the course and the fact that I would be learning something completely new. Age is also a factor for me. I am in my 50s and starting a completely new career is more than a little worrisome.

So far Bloc, however, has been great. Although I feel like I'm learning a foreign language most of the time, my mentor says I'm doing fine. I compare the experience a lot of times to taking math courses back in middle and high school, where you learn a concept, don't really understand it, but figure it will begin to make sense as time goes on. And usually it does.

I am very pleased with the changes that Bloc has made to its program lately. One of the things that I found that held me up was because I'm on the plan that only meets with my mentor once a week, if I got stuck, often I couldn't move forward until I actually met with him. So the change to allow us to get feedback from other mentors through Slack is a great change in my opinion as I can get unstuck faster.

I also like the group sessions, particularly the taped ones because I can watch when I have some free time and try to see if others have some of the same questions as me. I try to fit in at least one live session every other month. However, I am working 2 jobs while trying to keep up with my Bloc work, and time is the one that that is definitely at a premium with me.

I have an email in to Bloc see what I can do to try to catch up with my coursework as, due to work challenges, health challenges, and just life challenges, I have fallen behind. Hopefully I will hear from the Bloc folks soon to let me know what my options are.
