Bloc-Jams started by giving us an introduction to HTML and CSS with a "live" program. We actually created HTML tags used CSS to create the look of the page.. We created files for the overall music collection, as well as for individual albums.

Jeykll supports the use of [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) with inline HTML tags which makes it easier to quickly write posts with Jekyll, without having to worry too much about text formatting. A sample of the formatting follows.

Tables have also been extended from Markdown:

First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell

Here's an example of an image, which is included using Markdown:

Highlighting for code in Jekyll is done using Pygments or Rouge. This theme makes use of Pygments by default.

{% highlight js %}
// count to ten
for (var i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

// count to twenty
var j = 0;
while (j < 20) {
    j++;
    console.log(j);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Type Theme uses KaTeX to display maths. Equations such as $$S_n = a \times \frac{1-r^n}{1-r}$$ can be displayed inline.

Alternatively, they can be shown on a new line:

$$ f(x) = \int \frac{2x^2+4x+6}{x-2} $$
