title: My Goals As a Developer
---

My goals as a developer started very simply. Having come out of the print publishing industry, I desired to update my skills to something more relevant. I have also been a project manager for many years, and wanted to see if I could transition that over to coding, as well. Therefore my reasons for learning to frontend code, while a little mercenary, are as follows:

1) To be able to earn a living while performing a skill that is currently in high demand
2) To become proficient in current coding, which currently offers many opportunities for employment
3) To have the ability to transition my years of project management experience to another industry, and again, have skills that are in demand
4) To learn a skill that does not require a 4-year degree (although I already have one of those), where those hiring care whether you can do the work, not how old you are or if you have a piece of paper proving you have a college degree
5) To become relevant in the workforce again

**My Short-Term Goals**
1) To finish my Bloc coursework
2) To get back on track time-wise with my coursework
3) To make sure I learn enough to be hireable
4) To maximize the opportunities for group sessions, mentoring, and anything else that Bloc offers
5) To get a decent paying job
6) To continue to learn and grow as a developer.
