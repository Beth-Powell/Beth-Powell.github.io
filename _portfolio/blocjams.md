**Summary**

Bloc Jams is a digital music player like Spotify that Bloc uses to teach students frontend web development—HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery.

**Explanation**

The Bloc-Jams project gave me an introduction to HTML and CSS with my first "live" program. I actually created HTML tags and used CSS to create the look of the landing page, as well as creating files for the overall music collection and for individual albums.

**Problem**

There were many challenges encountered while working on the Bloc Jams program, probably due to the sheer amount of concepts that we were introduced to during the Project. The most challenging to me language-wise was learning JQuery, but the most challenging part of the project was getting the song-handler start/stop buttons and play bars working properly.

**Solution(s)**

To solve my Jquery questions/challenges, I worked closely with my mentor and did many Google searches to try to answer the questions I had. I am also considering some outside time to maybe take additional JQuery tutorials to try to help me learn this. If Bloc offers Group Sessions on JQuery, I will take those as well.

To get the start/stop buttons and play bar working properly, I went back over all of the code pretty much line by line with my mentor to make sure that I understand what each portion was doing, and I learned the hard way to console.log carefully to be able to track what was working and what wasn't to try to track down where the problem was.

Also, as I worked on this case study assignment and was looking back at the Checkpoints completed, I realized just how much area we had covered. Theefore, I decided to start a set of electronic notes to touch on the concepts taught and make sure that I can look back over them easily without having to open each Checkpoint to review.

**Results**

The final result is a partially completed Bloc Jams program that has the initial landing page, a Collections page that shows albums, and an individual album page that shows the specific songs and allows you to start and stop the songs. More work is to be done on this program in our upcoming Project using React to work more on this program.

**Conclusion**

Working through the Bloc Jams project has allowed me to skimmed the surface of HTML, CSS, DOM Scripting, and JQuery enough to make me familiar with the concepts, although there is clearly still much to learn.
